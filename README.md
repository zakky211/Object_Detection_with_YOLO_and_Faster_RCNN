# Person_Detection_with_YOLO_and_Faster_RCNN

- Person detection is one of the unique capabilities in the field of Computer Vision to locate objects (persons) both in images and videos.
- The purpose of person detection is to recognize and understand the presence of persons in visual data and make decisions based on that information.
- The benefits of person detection include: criminal investigation, missing person search, biometric research, etc.

The Issue of Person Detection
- The problem that arises is how computers can perform person detection with the highest accuracy.
- Therefore, Deep Learning methods are needed with the goal of achieving accurate person detection.

Dataset
- The COCO dataset contains various images with different objects in everyday contexts. This dataset was developed by Microsoft and consists of over 200,000 images with more than 80 different object categories.
- The data used in this testing includes the Coco dataset with the "Person" class. The amount of data used is 3000 training samples and 500 testing samples.
- Each image in the dataset is provided with annotations in the form of bounding boxes that indicate the location and size of the objects present in the image. These annotations include four values: the x and y coordinates of the top-left corner of the bounding box, as well as the width and height of the bounding box.
